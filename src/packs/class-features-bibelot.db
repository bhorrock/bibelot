Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</p>\n<p>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade's talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</p>\n<p>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thieves' guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<table style=\"height: 92px; width: 98.5222%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 11.5381%;\">Leve</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 87.2119%;\">Feature</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 11.5381%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 87.2119%;\">\n<p>Proficiency in medium armor and the scimitar.<span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Times;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Fighting Style: Dueling or Two Weapon Fighting</p>\n<p>Blade Flourish:</p>\n<p>Attack action on your turn will add 10ft to your movement, and a hit will allow you to use <strong>one</strong> of:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 16\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><strong>Defensive Flourish</strong>.
